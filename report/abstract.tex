        In recent years, the amount of text based complex documents increased significantly, along with the importance of ability to classify texts as efficiently and accurately as possible. We had traditional algorithms to tackle the text classification problem, but with the progressive computational power, many machine learning, especially deep learning, based solutions surpassed the human capabilities in this area. Lately, BERT based models overshadow the remaining approaches in the text classification area. On the other hand, we have the trending topic of graph neural networks (GNNs). They are geometric extensions, i.e., extensions of traditional neural network architectures to the graph domain, and graph-structured data. In recent years, there has been some developments in the text classification area, especially using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). In this project, a brief overview of text classification problem and of graph neural networks are provided. Text classification overview covers the fundamental steps of a text classification task with the indication of GNN integration, where the GNN overview provides the reasons, challenges and how-tos of utilizing GNNs. Then, we provide an overview of the related work that tackles the text classification problem with the GNNs, while comparing several approaches. Finally in this project, we present a text classification approach that combines the BERT models, that provide semantic and contextual information, with the GCN models, that provide structural and global information.\footnote[4]{The source code of the project is provided in its \href{https://github.com/tunakasif/eee586}{GitHub Page}}
